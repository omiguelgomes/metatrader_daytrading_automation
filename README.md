Project Description:

Developed a Python-based automated trading strategy for MetaTrader 4, focusing on intraday trading of foreign exchange currencies. The strategy utilized technical indicators derived from historical price data (time candles) to make trading decisions. Backtesting and live testing were conducted to evaluate performance.

Key Skills Demonstrated:

Python programming
Algorithmic trading
MetaTrader 4 API integration
Technical analysis using time candles
Backtesting and performance analysis
Additional Notes:

Due to ethical and regulatory limitations, specific details about the strategy and performance cannot be disclosed.
